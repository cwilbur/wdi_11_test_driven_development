# Exercises in Test-Driven Development

## Introduction

Many of the things we've taught in this course have been primarily things you *know* -- you know how to write a function, you know how to build a REST service.  Test-driven development is different in that it's learning a new habit of thinking

## Objectives

* Students will learn about and practice the different phases and principles of the red-green-refactor cycle of test development.
* Students will learn about and practice pair programming, specifically the ping-pong approach to test-driving while pairing.

## How it works:

Because we're changing our way of thinking, we're going to start with small self-contained practice problems.  Ideally, these are problems where there it is clear to us whether the answer is right or wrong, but the algorithm is unclear. It can also be helpful (depending on temperament and personality) if the problems are ones we think we know the answers to already: that adds to the discipline of strict test-driven development.  Also, our ideal problem will have either a lot of useful test cases of increasing complexity or will have increasingly complex requirements that we can add one at a time.

The problem I will use as my example:  turning an ordinary decimal number into Roman numerals.

We start with all the infrastructure set up: we have a source code file and a test file, with no source code in either. 



### Phase one: RED

The first thing we do is to write a failing test

This is extremely information-dense, so don't be surprised if you have to read it a couple times over.
